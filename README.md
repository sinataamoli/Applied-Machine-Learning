## Session 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

In this session, we introduced the course goals, discussed the foundations of machine learning, and explored basic Python functions through hands-on coding.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- What is Machine Learning?
- Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning
- Real-world applications of ML
- Importance of data preparation and evaluation

**Hands-On Exercise:**
- Simulating a random walk in Python
- Using core Python built-in functions: `abs()`, `all()`, `any()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`

This session established a conceptual and technical baseline for the rest of the course.

## Session 2: Object-Oriented Programming and Probabilistic Thinking

This session introduced two important computational and statistical tools: object-oriented programming (OOP) for modular code development, and probabilistic programming for reasoning under uncertainty.

### Part 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
We discussed the fundamental principles of OOP and implemented custom classes in Python.

**Key Concepts:**
- `class` vs `object`
- Attributes and methods
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation and reusability

**Applications:** OOP allows the creation of reusable, maintainable, and scalable code—vital for building large ML pipelines or simulation tools.

### Part 2: Introduction to Probabilistic Programming
Students were introduced to Bayesian inference and how probability distributions are used to model uncertainty.

**Key Concepts:**
- Probability distributions and likelihood
- Bayesian inference and belief updating
- Gaussian functions and prior/posterior reasoning

**Applications:** This forms the foundation of modern probabilistic machine learning, including Bayesian networks, generative models, and decision-making systems.

## Session 3: Least Squares and Parameter Estimation

In this session, we explored one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning and statistical modeling: the **least squares method**. We demonstrated how it can be used to fit models to data and estimate parameters by minimizing the squared error between observed and predicted values.

### Key Concepts:
- Least squares as an optimization objective
- Parameterized functions (e.g., $y = \alpha x e^{\gamma x}$)
- Sampling parameter space to minimize loss
- Connection between minimizing squared error and maximizing likelihood under Gaussian noise

### Applications:
Least squares fitting is a cornerstone of regression analysis and appears in nearly all forms of supervised learning, from simple linear regression to complex neural networks.

## Session 4: Monte Carlo Simulation and Bayesian Inference

This session introduced Monte Carlo methods for probabilistic simulation and applied them to a coin-flipping experiment to test fairness. We used the binomial distribution and Bayesian inference to estimate the probability of heads in repeated coin tosses.

### Key Concepts:
- Monte Carlo simulation using random sampling
- Modeling coin tosses with the binomial distribution
- Prior and posterior distributions
- Uniform priors and Bayesian updating

### Applications:
Monte Carlo methods are widely used in risk assessment, computational physics, probabilistic modeling, and evaluating systems where analytical solutions are intractable.

## Session 5: Clustering and K-Means

This session focused on **unsupervised learning**, specifically clustering, where the goal is to group similar data points without using labels. We introduced the K-means clustering algorithm and explored its working principles through implementation and visualization.

### Key Concepts:
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Clustering as a way to discover hidden patterns
- K-means algorithm: initialization, assignment, update steps
- Choosing the number of clusters and evaluating results

### Applications:
Clustering is used in customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, document classification, and bioinformatics to find meaningful groups in complex datasets.

## Session 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

In this session, we transitioned from unsupervised clustering to supervised classification using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. This method assigns class labels based on the majority vote of a data point’s k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

### Key Concepts:
- Difference between classification and regression
- Basics of supervised learning
- Nearest Neighbor and KNN algorithm
- Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance)

### Applications:
KNN is widely used in recommendation systems, handwriting recognition, pattern classification, and medical diagnostics. It serves as a simple yet effective non-parametric model.

## Session 6 & 7: Supervised Learning and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This combined session continued our discussion on clustering and introduced **supervised learning**, where models are trained on labeled data. We focused on one of the simplest yet powerful classification techniques — the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

### Key Concepts:
- Overview of supervised learning: regression vs. classification
- K-Nearest Neighbor: lazy learning algorithm
- Importance of distance metrics and neighborhood size (k)
- Feature-label mappings in classification tasks

### Applications:
KNN is practical for image recognition, document categorization, spam detection, and other problems where decision boundaries are nonlinear and data is plentiful. It also serves as a baseline model for evaluating more complex classifiers.

## Session 8: Regression and Gradient Descent

In this session, we returned to regression and examined how optimization techniques can help us estimate model parameters. We discussed analytical and numerical methods for minimizing error functions, focusing on **gradient descent** for linear regression.

### Key Concepts:
- Supervised learning and hypothesis space
- Regression problem setup with feature vectors
- Linear model in matrix form: $y = Xw$
- Analytical solution using normal equations
- Gradient descent for iterative optimization

### Applications:
Gradient descent is at the heart of many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, logistic regression, and matrix factorization. Understanding it is crucial for tuning models efficiently on large-scale datasets.

## Session 9: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent and Optimization Techniques

This session advanced the discussion on optimization by introducing **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** and **mini-batch gradient descent**. These methods allow us to scale learning to large datasets by updating weights incrementally.

### Key Concepts:
- Limitations of full-batch gradient descent
- Stochastic vs. mini-batch updates
- Trade-offs between convergence speed and stability
- Implementation of mini-batch logic in training loops

### Applications:
Mini-batch optimization is critical in training large models efficiently. It's used in nearly all modern neural network frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and helps improve generalization through noise injection during updates.

## Session 10: Introduction to Neural Networks

In the final session of the course, we introduced **neural networks**—a powerful class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain. We focused on understanding the structure and function of feedforward neural networks.

### Key Concepts:
- Neurons, activation functions, and network architecture
- Forward propagation of input data through layers
- Importance of non-linearity for learning complex patterns
- Training using gradient descent and backpropagation

### Applications:
Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and generative modeling.
